# ⚠️ Retired and Archived

Vue Routisan is being retired in favour of a TypeScript rewrite under a new name, which is yet to be announced. This repository is being archived as a result.

The new package will employ the same principles of Routisan, however the interface will be simpler and a lot easier to digest, even for those with minimal Vue experience. When the new package is released, it is recommended that all users of v2 and v3 move to the new package. An migration guide will be made available when this happens. 

**Note:** The [current documentation site](https://vue-routisan.rockett.pw/) for v3 will remain available until such time as the new package has been released. The new package will also get a brand new docs site, powered by [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/).

Routisan provides you with a friendlier way to declare route definitions for Vue Router. Inspired by Laravel, it uses chained calls to build up your routes, allowing you to group and nest as deeply as you like.

```js
Route.view('blog', 'Blog').name('blog').children(() => {
  // All Posts
  Route.view('/', 'Blog/Posts').name('posts')

  // Single Post
  Route.view('{post}', 'Blog/Post').name('single-post').children(() => {
    Route.view('edit', 'Blog/Post/Edit').name('edit')
    Route.view('stats', 'Blog/Post/Stats').name('stats')
  })
})
```

This produces an array of routes in the format Vue Router expects to see, and follows a behaviour somewhat similar to Laravel’s router, such as:

- Using callbacks to iteratively collect routes
- Correctly joining nested routes together, regardles of prefixed slashes
- Correctly joining the names of nested routes, using a separator of your choice

## Upgrading from v2.x

Keep in mind that Routisan 3 is currently in beta. It is suitable for production use, but it would be wise to wait for the stable release before using it in large projects where potential breaking changes might make the upgrade path unnecessarily complex.
